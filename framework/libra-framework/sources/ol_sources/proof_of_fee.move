  // Here we place the bidders into their seats.

  // One important aspect of picking the next validator set:
  // It should have 2/3rds of known good ("proven") validators
  // from the previous epoch. Otherwise the unproven nodes, who
  // may not be ready for consensus, might be offline and cause a halt.
  // Validators can be inattentive and have bids that qualify, but their nodes
  // are not ready.
  // So the selection algorithm needs to stop filling seats with "unproven"
  // validators if the max unproven nodes limit is hit (1/3).

  // The paper does not specify what happens with the "Jail reputation"
  // of a validator. E.g. if a validator has a bid with no expiry
  // but has a bad jail reputation does this penalize in the ordering?
  // This is a potential issue again with inattentive validators who
  // have have a high bid, but again they fail repeatedly to finalize an epoch
  // successfully. Their bids should not penalize validators who don't have
  // a streak of jailed epochs. So of the 1/3 unproven nodes,
  // we'll first seat the validators with Jail.consecutive_failure_to_rejoin < 2,
  // and after that the remainder.

  // There's some code implemented which is not enabled in the current form.
  // Unsealed auctions are tricky. The Proof Of Fee
  // paper states that since the bids are not private, we need some
  // constraint to minimize shill bids, "bid shading" or other strategies
  // which allow validators to drift from their private valuation.
  // As such per epoch the validator is only allowed to revise their bids /
  // down once. To do this in practice they need to retract a bid (sit out
  // the auction), and then place a new bid.
  // A validator can always leave the auction, but if they rejoin a second time in the epoch,
  // then they've committed a bid until the next epoch.
  // So retracting should be done with care. The ergonomics are not great.
  // The preference would be not to have this constraint if on the margins
  // the ergonomics brings more bidders than attackers.
  // After more experience in the wild, the network may decide to
  // limit bid retracting.

  // The Validator must qualify on a number of metrics:
  // 1. have funds in their Unlocked account to cover bid,
  // 2. have miniumum viable vouches,
  // 3. and not have been jailed in the previous round.
